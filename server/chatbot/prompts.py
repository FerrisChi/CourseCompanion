ECE1786H - Creative Applications of Natural Language Processing
Course: Creative Applications of Natural Language Processing
Department Code: ECE
Department: Electrical and Computer Engineering
.Prerequisites: APS360H, CSC311H, ECE324H, ECE1513H, or equivalent.There has been truly remarkable progress in the capabilities of computers to process and generate language. This course covers Deep Learning approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP), from word vectors to Transformers, including chatGPT and GPT-4. It is a project-based course that teaches the fundamentals of neural-network-based NLP and gives students the opportunity to pursue a unique project..The course lecture material begins with the basics of word-level embeddings - their properties and training. These form the basis of neural-network-based classifiers employed to do classification of sentiment, named entity recognition and many other language tasks. A significant part of the course is about the Transformer architecture - its structure, training and how it generates language. This will include the use of the transformer as a classifier, but also as in generative mode, in which language is produced in response to input language. Much of the learning will be applied in four hands-on programming assignments and in a major project. Students will work in groups of 2 to propose a project of their own choosing that makes use of these capabilities. They will execute the project and both present it formally and write a report on it..

.It is very hard to hand-design programs to solve many real-world problems, e.g. distinguishing images of cats vs. dogs. Machine learning algorithms allow computers to learn from example data, and produce a program that does the job. Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms originally inspired by the brain, but which have recently have seen a lot of success at practical applications. Theyâ€™re at the heart of production systems at companies like Google and Facebook for image processing, speech-to-text, and language understanding. This course gives an overview of both the foundational ideas and the recent advances in neural net algorithms..
